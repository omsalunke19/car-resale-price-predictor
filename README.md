## Introduction

The Car Resale Price Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that predicts the resale prices of used cars. It helps both buyers and sellers in the pre-owned car market make informed decisions by estimating the expected value of a car based on various features.

This system uses a machine learning model that has been trained on historical car resale data. It takes input from users, such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant information, and then provides an estimated resale price. This can be particularly helpful when negotiating prices or setting a fair selling price for your car.

## Features

- Predicts the resale price of a car based on various features.
- Supports a wide range of car makes and models.
- User-friendly interface for inputting car details.
- Provides an estimated price range for more transparency.
- Helpful for both buyers and sellers in the pre-owned car market.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for model training, optional)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-resale-prediction.git
cd car-resale-prediction
```

2. Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application.

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the application by running `app.py`.

2. Input the car's details, including make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant information.

3. Click the "Predict Price" button to get the estimated resale price.

4. The system will display the estimated price range and other useful information.

## Model Training

If you want to retrain the model using your own dataset, you can use the Jupyter Notebook provided in the `model_training` directory. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the `model_training` directory.

```bash
cd model_training
```

2. Open the `Car_Resale_Price_Prediction_Model_Training.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model with your data.

4. Save the trained model and update it in the `models` directory.

## Data

The model used for prediction is trained on historical car resale data. If you want to use your own data for training, make sure it follows a similar structure:

- Car make
- Car model
- Year
- Mileage
- Transmission
- Fuel type
- Number of owners
- Location
- Price
-
